        "unparsedLocationSentence": "Stirred to join the throng of hyper-efficient planners, I booked breakfast at 9am on the opening morning at the Corinthia in Whitehall, London, in its semi-new outdoor area called “the Garden”. I would, I decided, sweep in on a crisp, sunny spring morning wearing a nice frock and strappy sandals, order eggs and drink a big breakfast bloody mary to see off the misery of the previous 12 months. If I'm honest, I touted this plan around like a weapon when anyone told me about their own arrangements. Oh, you’ve got a week booked in a sea-view suite on the Lizard peninsula, have you? Did you know about my 12 April breakfast at the Corinthia? Pardon, what’s that? Your whole family is double-vaccinated and you’ve a light pencil on a Greek holiday villa in late July? Well, did I tell you that the Corinthia garden has hot-water bottles and I’ll probably pop into Kerridge’s Bar & Grill for lunch to eat the swanky, bespoke fish and chips? The problem with this game is, there are no winners; the other problem with plans – especially post-pandemic ones – is that you actually have to go through with them: cancelling is morally iffy when every hospitality venue is already on its knees. So, on 12 April, having alerted everyone to how clever I was to take the momentous day off, I woke up to the sort of wet, sideways snow that isn’t heavy or pretty enough to feature in a Wham! video, but will still take the shine off your scrambled eggs on sourdough because your pants are damp and your hair is welded to your head by melted hairspray.\n But what struck me most as I set off on Day 1 of Life Mark II was how awry I was about re-entering the real world. And how curiously guilty I felt for carrying on into this fresh next chapter, wobbling towards the light on Bambi legs, when others I’d lost over the past year are no longer here to feel that joy. There was a certain safety in being sat night after night on the same sofa, but we can’t stay there for ever. My plan right now is to stop planning altogether, and remember that life is for living.",

        "unparsedLocationSentence": "Full cupboards felt like some form of protection. I bought dried semolina and sago, despite finding both a torture in childhood. I bought tinned pineapple slices for vitamin C and bags of split lentils that fell from my highest shelves, half-stunning me each time I looked for the marmalade. With these abundant supplies, I had made myself semi-invincible. World order may crumble and anarchy prevail, but at least I had Tiptree seedless raspberry jam to last me until Christmas. If things got really bad, I thought, I might make rock buns. After all, I had plenty of dried fruit in. As it transpires, though, full shelves haven't saved us from the sadness of Covid. Thousands of us have died and millions of us have lost our mums, our dads, our colleagues, friends and neighbours. All that frantic, sharp-elbowed shopping was really only ever a displacement activity. The virus doesn’t care if its victims have got a chest freezer brimming with fish fingers or an under-stairs cubbyhole stocked up with kidney beans. It doesn’t care if you have everything in to make fairy cakes. It kills people with bulging cupboards and people with hardly any food at all, and it robs others of smell, taste and appetite.\n If I have learned anything from the pandemic, it is that any stockpiling I have done was just a fig leaf over selfishness and existential panic, and that my needs to survive are actually pathetically minuscule. I need some daily carbs, some fruit, some earl grey, perhaps the odd glass of wine. I need the occasional Hobnob biscuit and my friends chatting nonsense on WhatsApp. I need the sound of a loved one’s voice on the phone asking, “You OK?”, and a round of freezer-bread toast for a lunch that is actually breakfast. The rest is all just faff. I’m easier to maintain, it turns out, than the average bonsai.\n One year on, as we edge towards freedom, I often think of the spare rooms, larders and cupboards across Britain still crammed with flour, rice, yeast, cooking chocolate, suet and scone mix; all those tins of processed peas and cartons of UHT that we bought to stave off a pandemic. Perhaps right now is the time for some of us to set those items free, and give them to those who actually need them. I’ve begun sheepishly taking stuff back to the supermarket to leave in the food bank boxes. Join me! Take back control of your cupboards! You have nothing to lose but your fears and your pasta bow-tie mountain.",

It was called Ottolenghi and its food display was a riot of colour and promise. Eating it looked like it might be a quick route to feeling good about yourself. “I became rather obsessed with it,” she says now. “I reckoned it wasn’t difficult to make this food. I just had to know what was in it.” Soon Ottolenghi opened an outpost in Islington. Sarah Lavelle, then an editor at Ebury Books, lived close by. “I went down one weekend and people were queueing out the door. I thought, ‘Something’s going on here.’” Merope Mills, then editor of the Guardian’s Weekend magazine, also visited. “I was looking for a new vegetarian cooking columnist,” she says. “And I was struck by all these brilliant-looking salads.”",

What matters is whether we spot the mistake and make amends. Which is what I told the judge, not that he seemed convinced. Where's mercy when you need it, eh? Happily, I am less ruthless. I’m quick to give credit where it’s due.

They have seen the error of their ways. Or at least some of them. Good for them.",

Just as the French bistro is likely to have a menu of frisée and lardon salad, steak frites and apple tart, so the British gastropub will offer a terrine, risotto and something involving beetroot and goat's cheese to start; a sea bass dish, pork belly and rib eye for mains; and a chocolate fondant, crème brûlée and lemon tart to finish.",

On my say so, a creature will breathe its last. This isn't very different from most mealtimes. Usually when I order lunch something has to die. As far as the vegan community is concerned I am steeped deep in blood. I recognise the point of view. I believe that those of us who eat things with a face need to understand what this means. Accordingly I have worked in an abattoir; have heard the squeals of stuck pigs and dragged their bleeding corpses down the pig tank to be de-bristled. I have watched cattle take the bolt, pulled skins off the still-warm carcasses of lambs. I have literally had blood on my hands. It did not change my eating habits one bit.",

In reality it will end up as a review of the pie we ate there. A bloody marvellous pie. So less a review than a love letter, written on paper scented with dripping. There are some people who, reading about this pie, will clench their fists and bang things. They will bellow that it is NOT A PIE, for that requires a pastry shell from top to bottom and around the sides. They write to me about this, these defenders of pie, with a fury out of all proportion to, well, most things. All I can say is that if you are the sort of person to get proper furious because I called a dish with a suet pastry lid a pie, then congratulations. You clearly have nothing more important to get cross about.",

It specialised in the dishes of Hunan; nothing could be served unless it had first been pelted with fistfuls of fresh and dried chillies, even dessert. I loved their \"dry pot\" chicken, the liquor in the wok bubbling to nothing over its burner, and the slices of pork belly with pickled soya beans. The management laminated my review and stuck it in the window. I walk past often and, being thus reminded of what a great time I'd had there, would pop in by myself, hunker down behind one of the wooden partitions and bury myself armpit deep in plates of fire and punch with a bit of pig thrown in for good measure.

In this case the industry is Shakespeare, described to me politely by one resident as being akin to \"a large spreading oak tree in the shade of which little else may prosper\". There are pros and cons to this depending upon who you are. For the town there is the tourist economy; for the restless eater, there is the deadening effect of a mass clientele that encourages restaurants into a mindset best categorised as \"don't scare the horses\". It is best represented by two hope-killing words: \"lite bites\". Stratford is full of menus pimping lite bites. You know what those words mean: not too much; just a little something; stuff on sticks; things slammed between bread. Deep-fried, wrapped-up objects with saucers full of sugar-burdened chilli dips.",

Something was bound to come along to sour the whole affair; to give the naysayers all the ammunition they needed. Hell, to load the gun for the naysayers and hand it to them. Something has. That something is called Wishbone. It's a café in Brixton's old Market Row serving fried chicken and cocktails. It's all those pimped-up dirty-food clichés you've been reading about in one messy, shoot-me-now package. And it's just wrong.",

It is Saint-Emilion au chocolat, an intense chocolate mousse made with the crunch of amaretti biscuits. The first reference to it in this country appears in Elizabeth David's French Country Cooking, published in 1951, which explains why it turned up a few years later on the menu at the Hole in the Wall in Bath. The restaurant's founder, George Perry-Smith, was hugely influenced by David, though he said he got his recipe off the back of a box of Old Glory matches. In the 70s, Perry-Smith moved to Helford in Cornwall, where he opened his own restaurant, and also worked with the great Joyce Molyneux at the Carved Angel in Dartmouth.",

Inside, the echoes don't immediately fade. Karpo – apparently she's the Greek goddess of the fruits of the earth – is the bolt-on restaurant of an inner-city hotel, and looks like it. There are refectory-style tables and benches at one end, and, at the other, by the open kitchen, a stunted atrium with a living wall of foliage bolting upwards to the sunlight.

Made in Belfast was that special kind of shabby which makes you want to kick cats, write angst-ridden letters to Reader's Digest and shake your fists at the sky shouting, \"Why, God?

Meal for two, with wine and service, gulp, £200  The problem with surprises is that not all of them are nice. A pink macaroon flavoured with Iberico ham served as a petit four is a complete surprise. It's definitely not a nice one. When you are left thinking: \"I wish that had been lemon or raspberry or anything other than this\", something is up. Sure, I can admire the technique by which all that hammy flavour is slipped into one of those sweet crisp meringue almond confections. That doesn't make it more pleasant to eat. Equally a tiny chocolate roulade with a sweet cream flavoured with ceps served as a dessert is eye-achingly clever. But that doesn't make either one pleasant to eat. When you find yourself reaching for the word \"challenging\" to describe your dinner and wanting to shout: \"Who put all the bloody mushrooms in my pudding?\", it's time to get your coat.",

If you're searching for something echt, to satisfy the frummers, you've come to the wrong place. This is a Jewish deli by way of New York, as imagined by a bunch of non-Jews. Kosher it ain't.",

There was the irritation of phoning to confirm my booking only to have them phone two hours later to confirm my booking. There was the offer of a crappy table in the upstairs room, which we declined, demanding something in the main downstairs space; the attempts to fill our wine glasses despite being told we'd do it ourselves; the refusal to give me a rosé by the glass because the wine they serve that way was finished (10 days after launch) until I suggested they just open a different bottle; a failure of basic maths in calculating a split on the bill.",

When all else fails – the overconceptualised dining rooms that look like high-end hairdressers, the menus of pan-Asian knockoffs that taste like something has died, or clumsy modern British fiddly bits that feel like a crisis of national self-confidence – you should simply run as fast as you can towards someone with a thick Italian accent. Perhaps Britain's city centres could be fitted with gastronomic panic buttons: in case of dietary distress, or just overuse of ponzu and daikon, break glass, press button.

Meal for two, including wine and service, £110  I remember eating at the very first Hotel and Bistro du Vin in Winchester, in the mid-90s. It's not a night either my wife or I could forget. Blighted by infertility, we had started a course of IVF and gone away for the weekend because we would know the outcome that Saturday. The pregnancy test came back negative, and by the evening we were ready to eat and drink like nothing mattered, because it didn't much. It should have been a desperate, miserable meal, but it wasn't, and so much of that was down to the Hotel du Vin itself. The sommelier Gerard Basset and hotelier Robin Hutson had put together a seriously classy act – a smart, vaguely boho space full of guttering candles, painted wood panels and tasteful art. The staff were efficient and relaxed without being pious, and there was an eclectic menu of very 90s food – I recall a very good Thai crabcake with a sweet chilli jam – cooked by a thin, enthusiastic Yorkshireman in a bandana called James Martin. I wonder what became of him.",

The hours are brutal, the culture too sodden with machismo. And then of course there is a biological imperative. Careers in kitchens rarely cooperate with the demands of motherhood. And so for all those great names moving forward – Hartnett herself, Hélène Darroze at the Connaught, Skye Gyngell at Petersham Nurseries – they are still rare, which is ludicrous. I check my watch. Oh look. It's the 21st century. Aren't we beyond this? Certainly when I started searching for a restaurant in the Birmingham area (where I happened to be) run by women, the female-chef pickings were slim. Instead I was directed to Opus, a big city-centre brasserie where both the managing director and front-of-house manager are women.",

Meal for two, every second Wednesday of the month, £120 It is a cold, wet winter's lunchtime, but inside Little Italy on Soho's Frith Street there is palpable warmth which has nothing to do with central heating. It is the second Wednesday of the month and by tradition – a very new tradition, but a tradition all the same – that's the day the restaurant belongs to Elena Salvoni, as it once used to every day of the week. Elena, tiny, silver-haired, neatly dressed in black as ever, is the great Soho maître d', and has been for seven decades. Yes, seven – she is 90. She is a link to the kind of old Soho that people like me, who are nowhere near old enough to remember it, like to claim nostalgia for. She ran front of house at Café Bleu during the war, and then took over at the famed Bianchi's (on the site of what is now Little Italy),, moved to Escargot for another couple of decades before being given a berth at a restaurant named in her honour, Elena's L'Etoile in Charlotte Street.",

I read about a glossy chain of Italian restaurants, the Manchester branch of which is a favourite among footballers and John Prescott, and alarm bells go off. Jimmy Carr tweets from there to tell the world what a lovely time he's having. None of these things make me want to run in bellowing 'I'll have what they're having'. This is because I'm a snob. When I hear that this Manchester branch of the empire claims a turnover – around £170,000 in good week – which puts it on a par with the Wolseley as the highest grossing dining spot in Britain, the alarms are joined by flashing lights. It makes proper money? Something must be wrong. And when I take a look at the menu and discover it is slightly longer than one of Peter F Hamilton's space operas (a reference for sci-fi buffs who will nod knowingly; the rest of you just need to be aware that Hamilton's books are breeze-block thick) I start locking the doors and drawing the curtains.

To be sure of finding another place like this you will have to head to Tokyo, where they cluster like so many pigeons around a split sack of seed. Here, restaurants with just one chef and seven seats are hardly common. But it really couldn't be simpler: an open kitchen where the young chef, a graduate of Mayfair's buttock-clenchingly expensive Umu, does his intense, detailed, obsessive-compulsive thing. There is a bar with three seats, so you can watch him doing it. Behind is a counter in the window with four seats looking out into Drummond Street, a road near Euston station famed only for its cheap Indian restaurants and colourful drunks.",

This has nothing to do with the food, which is why you should go, and everything to do with the decor, which is perhaps why you shouldn't. The Grill used to be one of London's most traditional restaurants, where men who dreamed of nursey went for pieces of meat garnished with woody stalks of watercress. A year or two back they closed it for a renovation. As I understand it, the concept meeting went like this. What do we serve? Scottish smoked salmon and beef. Right then, a Scottish theme it is. Then they got a designer whose vision of Scottishness was part Disney, part shortbread-biscuit box, part Briga-bloody-doon by way of Banksy.",

The cab ride out across the dull marshlands didn't raise the mood much. I began to wish I'd punched that Samaritans number into my mobile just in case. Then I made it through the doors of the Sportsman, and things perked up hugely. A gentle white light suffused a room stripped back from its pub beginnings to the essentials: bare floorboards, bare wood tables and plain walls, broken by the odd bash of colour from photographs of the local shore. It could stand as a metaphor for the highly accomplished food served here. I had heard on the grapevine that the chef, Stephen Harris, takes his small team to eat in London's grandest, in search of ideas. I was fascinated to see how the experience of eating the food of, say, Gordon Ramsay or Heston Blumenthal might influence the dishes served by a self-taught chef in a Kentish pub.

They're always full of overstressed office workers plotting to have raucous sex at orgies to which I will never be invited. But the new restaurant's promotional literature was enticing. Philip Owens, a chef who has been around the London jumps, has been brought in to upgrade the catering side of the old wine merchants' retail business, and he claims to be doing so through a menu built on organic ingredients, British classics and slow-cooked food. It is the kind of thing I - and to be a touch schoolmarmish for a moment - you should be interested in.",
